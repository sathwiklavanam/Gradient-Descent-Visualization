# Gradient-Descent-Visualization
This project demonstrates the progression of gradient descent while fitting a linear regression model. It includes:  - A simple linear regression implemented from scratch in Python - A visualization of how the model parameters evolve over time - A matplotlib graph that shows regression lines at each iteration
